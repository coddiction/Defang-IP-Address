# Defang-IP-Address
Defanging IP Address using Python and C++

A user’s IP address is defanged to prevent the user from clicking on a malicious link. The problem with Defanginig IP addresses is one of the common coding interview questions.

To convert an IP address to a defanged IP address, we need to replace “.” with “[.]”. During coding interviews, a standard problem for changing an IP address is that you receive a valid IP address, you must return a defanged version of that IP address.
